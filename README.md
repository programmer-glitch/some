Sdl2 OpenGl Mini Engine.

## Getting started
Fork this repo and have fun

## Example Apps
- [Pixelc](https://github.com/renehorstmann/Pixelc): A pixel art editor.
- [Tilec](https://github.com/renehorstmann/Tilec): A tile map editor.
- [JumpHare](https://github.com/renehorstmann/JumpHare): Platformer game.

## e
e_* is for window and environment management, like window, input, sdl stuff...
- e_gui: [nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) based debug gui
## r
r_* is for OpenGL rendering

## u
Utilities like setting up a 2D pose

## p
Physics

## mathc
glsl like math library for C, see [Mathc](https://github.com/renehorstmann/Mathc)

## utilc
C utility functions like dynamic arrays, see [Utilc](https://github.com/renehorstmann/Utilc)


## Compiling for Web
Using Emscripten:
```
emcc -I../include/ -s USE_SDL=2 -s USE_SDL_IMAGE=2 -s USE_SDL_TTF=2 -s FULL_ES3=1 -s SDL2_IMAGE_FORMATS='["png"]' --preload-file ../res -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 -DUSING_GLES -DUSING_TOUCH ../src/e/*.c ../src/p/*.c ../src/r/*.c ../src/u/*.c ../src/*.c -o index.html
```

## Compiling on Windows
Compiling with Mingw (msys2).
Currently not working with cmake, but with the following gcc call.
I had to put all source files into one dir (from src/e/*, r/*, p/*, u/* into src/*) to get the linker happy.
```
gcc -o some src/* -Iinclude $(sdl2-config --cflags --libs) -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lglew32 -lopengl32 -lglu32 -DUSING_GLEW
```
